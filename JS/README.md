A robust backend solution built on **Google Apps Script** that serves as the central hub for church administration and community engagement. This project acts as a middleware between Google's productivity suite (Sheets & Calendar) and mobile applications (iOS/Android).

## 🏗 System Architecture

The project leverages Google Cloud Infrastructure to provide a lightweight, scalable, and cost-effective backend:
- **Middleware:** Google Apps Script (JavaScript)
- **Data Storage:** Google Sheets (Relational-style Document DB)
- **Scheduling:** Google Calendar API
- **Client Interface:** JSON via Web App API

## ✨ Features

- **🗓 Real-time Calendar Sync:** Fetches worship schedules and events directly from Google Calendar with quarterly filtering.
- **📆 Automated Data Management:** Manages quarterly service plans stored in structured Google Sheets.
- **🔐 Secure Access:** Token-based authentication for data retrieval and simple user login system.
- **🔄 Instant Updates:** Allows authorized users to update service details (e.g., moderators, speakers, cleaners) directly from the mobile app.
